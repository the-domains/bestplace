Travel smart. Go beyond the sights. Experience the local. Of course you came to Prague to see the Charles Bridge and the Prague Castle. We totally understand. But we want to give you an alternative: see the city from the local's perspective. Explore Prague more in depth. Get a better understanding of the people. In our eyes, our experiences are so much more than just "Prague food tours". We want to explain the Czechs: who we are, where we are coming from, and where we are heading. What do we offer?
